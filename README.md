# Walmart Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview

The Walmart Data Analytics Project aimed to simulate real-world decision-making challenges in a large retail store like Walmart. The goal was to analyze customer buying patterns, optimize store layouts, and improve cross-selling strategies using SQL-based analytics. The project involved designing a data warehouse, executing advanced SQL queries, and deriving business insights to support strategic decision-making.

## Tasks and Responsibilities

### Task 1: Design a Data Warehouse** 

Business Problem:Walmart deals with millions of transactions daily. To extract meaningful insights, a structured way to store and retrieve data was required. The CEO wanted to understand which products are most popular, which customer demographics spend the most, and how sales vary over time.

**Solution:**

Designed a data warehouse to organize Walmart's transactional data.

Created a central fact table to capture every transaction in the store.

Developed at least five supporting dimensions to provide meaningful context about products, customers, time periods, and other key attributes.

**Business Impact:**

What are the top-selling products in each category?

How do purchasing patterns change based on time or customer demographics?

Which types of promotions result in the highest sales?

### Task 2: Identify Frequently Bought Together Items

**Business Problem:**
Store managers noticed that customers often buy certain items together but lacked clear data on which combinations were the most frequent.

**Solution:**

Wrote SQL queries to identify frequently bought-together products.

Used window functions to analyze transaction patterns and derive meaningful insights.

Ensured that results excluded similar product variations (e.g., different types of milk counted as one).

**Business Impact:**

Reorganizing the store layout based on common product pairs.

Introducing bundled promotions to encourage larger purchases.

Optimizing inventory management to ensure high-demand products remain stocked.

### Task 3: Present Business Insights

Business Problem:After identifying frequently bought-together products, the findings had to be presented to Walmart’s leadership in a clear and actionable manner.

**Solution:**

Summarized findings into a business report for Walmart executives.

Provided recommendations on store layout adjustments, promotional strategies, and inventory management.

Justified how these changes could benefit Walmart’s bottom line.

**Business Impact:**

Example insight: "Milk and Cornflakes are the most frequently purchased items together in the Grocery category, appearing in transactions 10 times more often than any other combination."

Recommended placing these products closer together and offering bundle promotions, potentially leading to a 15% increase in cross-category sales.

## Team Contributions
